This is a folder to keep track of everything related to the takehome assignment.

The implementation used is based on the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- tqdm 

It also requires Guillaume's matplotlib configuration files and fonts and relies upon having the data filed stored in a folder data (`mkdir data`)
Everything can be run from the juopyer notebook attached. 

This can also be converted into code by using the command 

`$jupyter-nbconver -takeHome.py --to python`
